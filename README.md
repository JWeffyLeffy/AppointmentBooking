## Getting Started

To get started with the Appointment Booking App, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JWeffyLeffy/AppointmentBooking.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd AppointmentBooking
```

### 3. Configure environment variables:

Refer to the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section to set up the necessary `.env` files.

### 4. Build and run Docker containers:

From the project root, execute the following command to build images and start services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the `mongodb`, `server`, and `client` services.

### 5. Access the application:

- The frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`
- The backend API will be available at: `http://localhost:5000`

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive and environment-specific configurations.

### Server (`server/`)

Create `.env` files in the `server/` directory based on the `server/.env.example`.

- **Development (`server/.env.development`)**: Used when `NODE_ENV` is `development`.

```
# .env.development for Server
# Environment variables for development mode

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/appointmentbooking_dev
JWT_SECRET=your_development_jwt_secret_key
GMAIL=your_development_gmail_address@gmail.com
APP_PASSWORD=your_development_gmail_app_password
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
NODE_ENV=development
```

- **Production (`server/.env.production`)**: Used when `NODE_ENV` is `production`.

```
# .env.production for Server
# Environment variables for production mode

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_production_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_production_jwt_secret_key
GMAIL=your_production_gmail_address@gmail.com
APP_PASSWORD=your_production_gmail_app_password
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Client (`client/`)

The React client uses environment-specific `.env` files.

- **Development (`client/.env.development`)**: Used when `NODE_ENV` is `development` (e.g., `npm start`).

```
# .env.development for Client
# This file is used for development environment variables.

# API URL for the backend server during development.
# When running the client locally and the server locally or via docker-compose.
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

- **Production (`client/.env.production`)**: Used when `NODE_ENV` is `production` (e.g., `npm run build`).

```
# .env.production for Client
# This file is used for production environment variables.

# API URL for the backend server in production.
# This should be the public URL where your backend API is accessible.
# Example: REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-production-api-url.com
```
